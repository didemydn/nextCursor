# Data Booster Challange

this is a sample node js code to solve the flag challange. 
I created a recursive function which sends a request to the API collects the cursors and repeats this request process until there is no cursor. 
After 71 requests, I got the below message which is an indicator for the flag. 

'''

Next Cursor: undefined
No more cursors.
Total requests: 71
